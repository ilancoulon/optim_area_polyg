# Optimal area polygonalization

This project was made by Dana Chaillard and Ilan Coulon for the Ecole polytechnique's *INF562 Computational Geometry: from Theory to Applications* course given by Luca Castelli Aleardi in 2020.

This can be opened with Eclipse and the class AreaOptimizer can be launched with the name of any file in the **data** directory as a first argument.

You can read details about our implementation and its results in the [PDF report](https://github.com/ilancoulon/optim_area_polyg/blob/master/report.pdf).
